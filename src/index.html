                    <p>The map shows Malaysia has the highest average salary, despite the linecharts below showing otherwise. This is due to Malaysia only having 1 year of data, thus the Malaysian average salary is not comparable with other countries.</p>

                    <p>The barchart shows Oceania has the highest salary on average, which make sense as both Australia and New Zeeland have respective average salary.</p>
                    <p>Focusing in the Americas, despite the chart showing it is the second-highest paying region, the average is skewed towards the USA and Canada, the 2 countries with the highest salary on average. Therefore, it is reccomended to work in these 2 nations specifically, but not the America region as a whole.</p>

                    <p>For the 5 Highest Paying Countries, there's an overall decrease in average salary from 2020 to 2022, with Japan suffering the most, dropping from around $150000 in 2020 to around $50000 in 2022. The USA has been the top performer consistenly, with its average salary above/around $150000 for 3 years. Canada and the UK have been holding strong despite the massive dump of Japan and Russia.<p>
                    <p>For the 5 Lowest Paying Countries, India and Pakistan have a huge growth in average salary from 2021 to 2022. The salary in India even surpassed that of Russia and Japan in 2022.</p>
                    <p>To maximise the potential salary, the safests bet would be the USA, Canada and the UK, as they all had the least percentage of decrease in average salary, in comparison to other countries.</p>
